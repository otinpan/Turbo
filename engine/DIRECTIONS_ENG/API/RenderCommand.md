# RenderCommand API

KaniVolcano does not directly execute Vulkan resource operations inside game logic. Mesh creation, mesh updates, mesh destruction, and skybox changes are queued as `RenderCommand`s and executed later by `RenderSystem`.

RenderCommand API is the API for issuing those render commands.

Primitive creation is provided by Object API, but functions such as `spawn_triangle_3d()` and `spawn_rectangle_3d()` also use render commands internally. They create an entity, attach the required components, and queue a command to create the GPU mesh.

## Updating Primitive Meshes

Use `update_primitive_mesh()` to change an existing primitive mesh.

```rust
let polygon_mesh3d: MeshAssetId = context
    .primitive_asset_id(PrimitiveType::Polygon, VertexLayout::Mesh3D)
    .ok_or_else(|| anyhow!("not found polygon mesh3d"))?;

context.update_primitive_mesh(
    polygon_mesh3d,
    PrimitiveShape::Polygon {
        points: vec![
            vec3(0.0, -0.7, 0.3),
            vec3(0.0, -0.4, 0.2),
            vec3(0.0, 0.7, 0.5),
            vec3(0.0, 0.2, -0.2),
            vec3(0.0, -0.5, -0.45),
        ],
        color: vec3(1.0, 0.0, 0.0),
    },
);
```

Here, `primitive_asset_id(PrimitiveType, VertexLayout)` finds the mesh whose primitive type is `Polygon` and vertex layout is `Mesh3D`. Then `update_primitive_mesh()` queues a command to update that mesh.

This updates the mesh itself. If several entities share the same mesh, all of them will change.
